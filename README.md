# promises

Package promises mimics the JavaScript Promise API, but in Go. You definitely
don't need this package instead of ideomatic channels and goroutines, but
sometimes and in the some cases it can be handy.

See [the package documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/davidmz/go-promises)
for details.
